## Topic: Strings in Python

A **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed within quotes.  
Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces.

Strings are widely used in Python for **text handling and manipulation**, such as displaying messages, storing names, and processing user input.

## Creating a String

In Python, strings can be created using either:

- Single quotes `'...'`
- Double quotes `"..."`

### Example

```python
s1 = 'My name is'
s2 = "Jayaraj N"

print(s1)
print(s2)
```

### Output

```
My name is
Jayaraj N
```

## Concatenating and Repeating String

Python provides simple operators to **combine** and **repeat** strings.

### String Concatenation (+ Operator)

Strings can be joined together using the + operator.

#### Example: Joining two words with a space

```python
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"
s3 = s1 + " " + s2

print(s3)
```

#### Output

```
Hello World
```

### String Repetition (* Operator)

A string can be repeated multiple times using the * operator.

#### Example: Repeating a greeting three times

``` Python
s = "Hello "
print(s * 3)
```

#### Output

```
Hello Hello Hello
```
